        <p>The Exam Hall Seating Allotment System is a software solution designed to automate and streamline the process of assigning students to seats in an examination hall. Traditionally, manual seat allotment is time-consuming, prone to errors, and inefficient, especially for large institutions. This system ensures a systematic, fair, and conflict-free allocation of seats based on predefined criteria such as roll numbers, course codes, and hall capacities. The system takes inputs such as student details, exam schedules, and hall capacities to generate optimized seating plans while preventing issues like cheating by ensuring appropriate seat distribution. It also supports features like real-time updates, automated seat mapping, and printable seating charts. By leveraging database management and automation techniques, the system improves accuracy, reduces administrative workload, and enhances the overall examination process. For staff, the system automates invigilation duty assignments, ensuring that invigilators are evenly distributed across exam halls based on availability, workload balance, and institutional guidelines</p>
